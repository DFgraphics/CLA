This is a Graphic set for Dwarf Fortress, intended to be used with ASCII-like tilesets with a tile size of 18x18px such as Haowan or Myne.


HOW TO INSTALL MANUALLY:
0-delete everything in raw/graphics and data/saves/region#/raw/graphics (if you have existing saves) 
1-copy all files in DF folder and overwrite everything if prompted.
2-for existing saves, copy the new contents of raw/graphics into data/saves/region#/raw/graphics



HOW TO INSTALL GRAPHIC SET ONLY:

0-delete or move all files in raw/graphics (other graphic sets, example graphics).
1-put graphic set files (raw/graphics/: the folder 'CLA' and the textfiles) into raw/graphics.
2-Open data/init.txt with a text editor such as notepad (I suggest notepad++) and change [GRAPHICS:NO] to [GRAPHICS:YES].
3-generate new world and embark!

If you already have a save, you need to copy the files into data/saves/region#/raw/graphics instead
