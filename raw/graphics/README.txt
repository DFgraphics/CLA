This Graphic set is intended to be used with "low-fi", ASCII-like tilesets with a tile size of 18x18px such as Haowan or Myne.


HOW TO USE:

1-put files from this rar (the folder 'CLA' and the textfiles) into raw/graphics and delete/move all other files in there.
2-Open data/init.txt with a text editor such as notepad (I suggest notepad++) and change [GRAPHICS:NO] to [GRAPHICS:YES].
3-generate new world and embark!

If you already have a save, you need to copy the files into data/saves/region#/raw/graphics instead


To update, just download the newest STANDALONE pack and repeat the steps above.
